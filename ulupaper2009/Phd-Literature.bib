  abstract = {When exploring nearby prospects in a common area, the outcome of drilling a well can change the chance of success in nearby prospects, affecting their economics and drilling decisions. Here, besides possibly discovering hydrocarbons, a single well could also supply information about other wells. For such a cluster of exploration prospects, which well should we drill first, and which next? More importantly, what is the economic value of this group of prospects? The answers are multidimensional; they depend, at least, on geological dependencies and economic dynamics. Because it takes time to interpret each drilling outcome and update our understanding regarding neighboring prospects, the varying hydrocarbon prices also affect the economics of the upcoming wells. Therefore, our sequence of drilling decisions should consider both geological dependencies and uncertainty in prices. In this paper, we develop a valuation model for a group of interdependent prospects. We use a dynamic programming model that combines the binomial representation of prices with the conditional probability of success or failure at each drilling site. The software implementation of the algorithm accompanies this paper and is a useful valuation and decision-support system.},

  abstract = {We use a dynamic programming model to study the impacts of risk aversion on information acquisition in technology adoption decisions. In this model, the benefit of the technology is uncertain and, in each period, the decision maker (DM) may adopt the technology, reject the technology, or pay to acquire a signal about the benefit of the technology. The dynamic programming state variables are the DM's wealth and a probability distribution that describes the DM's beliefs about the benefit of the technology; these distributions are updated over time using Bayes' rule. If the signal-generating process satisfies the monotone-likelihood ratio property and the DM is risk neutral, the value functions and policies satisfy natural monotonicity properties: a likelihood-ratio improvement in the distribution on benefits leads to an increase in the value function and moves the DM away from rejection and toward adoption. With risk aversion, the value functions (now representing expected utilities) will be monotonic, but the policies need not be monotonic, even with reasonable utility functions. However, if we assume the DM exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion and is not ``too risk averse,'' the policies can be shown to be monotonic. Establishing these structural properties requires the use of some novel proof techniques that may prove useful in other contexts. We also study the impact of changing risk attitudes on the optimal policy.},

  abstract = {Many oil fields have gas caps or associated gas. The common approach for these fields is to continue to produce oil, whilst re-injecting any gas produced, for as long as it is profitable, and then produce gas. This approach is motivated by the belief that it will maximize the oil reserves and thus maximize the overall value of the field.},
